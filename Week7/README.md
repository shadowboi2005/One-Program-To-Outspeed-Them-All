# Applications of SAT Solvers
- Last week we built a "SAT Solver", this week we are going to use it
- But before we can, we need to `refine` the SAT solver
- We need to make it more interactive and usable
## SATSolver
- Find out how to do that by going through the `README.md` file of this folder
- Find out how to express an arbitary formula in Conjunctive Normal Form using `Tseitin Encoding`
## NP Complete Problems
- Use the SAT solver to solve actual problems rather than arbitary CNF Files
- These are tough problems but can be solved easily assuming access to an `Oracle` SAT Solver
