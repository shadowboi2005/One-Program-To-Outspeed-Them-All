# One-Program-To-Outspeed-Them-All
Welcome to our SOC "One Program To Outspeed Them All". Join us as we program keeping performance first and foremost!
Here is the tentative schedule:

## Week 0 : Setting up
- This week will be spent in setting up your coding environment. We recommend WSL as you can code in C/C++ without any hassle once you set up WSL.
- Install wsl : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
- Use ubuntu preferrably although pretty much any distribution should be okay (so if you do not have ubuntu don't panic and change your distribution lol you will probably be fine)
- In case you want to try using the manual install (as the default one may not work for everyone), follow this : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual
- Integrate WSL with visual studio code : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode
- Install git : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git
- Run the following command to install g++, gdb (optional but recommended), make : `sudo apt update && upgrade && sudo apt-get install build-essential && sudo apt install g++ gdb make ninja-build rsync zip`
- Run the following command to install python (we might need this for plotting performance) : `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip ipython3`
- Fork this git repository
- Instructions for forking: 
- Follow the instructions on : https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo
- Here are some practice questions to check your installation.
- Check g++ installation by completing the task described in compile.cpp 
- Complete the tasks in naive.cpp (implement naive Schur/Element-Wise Product of two vectors)
- Run the command `make` on the terminal to check Makefile installation
- Run the command `python3 grapher.py` to check python installation
- You might need to install some python modules like matplotlib or numpy in which case run pip install {nameOfModule}
## Week 1 : May the Threads be with you
- Familiarise yourself with the threading library threads of C++.
- Understand the concepts of mutual exclusions, race conditions and why locking is necessary (yes it is totally not from a core course of a certain department).
- Use locks and conditional variables in programs yourself and understand why they are necessary.
- Also using locks leads to delays so use them smartly and only where necessary.
- Follow the instructions given in the `README.md` file in the `Week1` folder
