# SAT
- In this week, we will be making powerfull `SAT` solvers
- Solving SAT is a hard and computationally expensive task, with a `nearly limitless` potential for optimizations
- There are 2 folders and only 2 tasks that you have to complete
## IntroToSAT
- This folder will give you a brief and unexhaustive introduction to what SAT is
- Get started by going through the `README.md` file
## CDCL
- In this folder, you are given an unoptimized implementation of the modern CDCL algorithm
- You are expected to optimize it and obtain strong speedups
- Get started by going through the `README.md` file
