# Week 4
- This is the first fully application focussed week
- We will be implementing the popular `numpy` library in C++
- This week will cover basic matrix operations as well as additional features numpy provides, such as broadcasting
- You only have to edit one `.cpp` file this week, in the `matrix` folder
- Go through the `tests` folder to test correctness of your implementation
- Go through the `timing` folder to check performance of your implementation
